![Project Initiation Step][4steps-pm-plan]

- Keep the plan as simple as possible relative to the size of the project
- Project Plans should cover the following:
	* Project Summary: high level summary of project origin and objectives
	* Work Breakdown Structure (WBS): Numbered task list
	* Resource Assignments: Who is doing the work
	* Project Schedule: Completion dates of tasks and milestones
	* Project Budget: How money is allocated to the project
	* Risk Assessment: What can go wrong, and how to deal with it
	* Communications: How the team is expected to interact
	* Change Control Process: How changes are handled
- Brainstorm with project team to create initial draft plan
- Project Manager refines plan with sponsor and customer
- Approved project plan forms a _baseline_

## Planning Process &sect;3, pg 33 ##

- Project Charter is the principal input to the project planning
- Project Manager should insist on signed charter before planning

Basic project planning is relatively straightforward (but hard work):

1. Break the work into manageable "chunks", forming a _Work Breakdown Structure_ (WBS)
- Identify dependencies between tasks
- Identify the duration of each task
- Assign resources to tasks
- Review, analyze, and refine the plan
- Get it approved

The refined plan is used to produce:

- A _Project Schedule_ (what needs to be done and when)
- A _Critical Path_  (the critical tasks that can affect the delivery date)
- A _Risk Plan_ (the things that can go wrong and how they will be handled)
- A _Communication Plan_ (how to communicate with stakeholders and when)
- A _Change Control Plan_ (how to handle changes)

> The Project Plan and Project Charter pull together virtually everything that is known about the project
> 

## Time for Planning &sect;3, pg 34 ##

How much time should be spent on planning a project?

- Just enough time to get a clear understanding of what's required to complete the project objectives
- __Rule of Thumb__: minimum 5 percent of a project duration should be spent on planning
- Not all planning happens upfront, but rather forms part of the iterative process inherent in projects

> If you don't spend the time planning you will spend the time reacting to negative consequences that arise from poor planning
> 

## Building a Team &sect;3, pg 35 ##

> Most important element of a project is the team; without it, the project cannot succeed
> 

- Project team participates in planning, implementing, and monitoring the work
- Project manager is responsible for maintaining a cohesive, functioning, and capable team
- Project manager must be involved with day-to-day interaction and operation of the team
- Project manager must be a good leader, listener, learner, and lecturer
- Project mamager must motivate and encourage the team

### Forming ###

- Obtain commitment from team members

- Ensure they have necessary resources
- Conduct kickoff meeting to engage team members and generate excitement
