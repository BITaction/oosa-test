## Learning Outcomes ##

- Section &sect;2.10 of the UML 2 course textbook (UMLUP)
- You will learn to:
	- Invoke UP as a SEP
	- Define the driving factors of UP
	- Explain UP as an iterative and incremental approach
	- Identify and explain the workflows of UP
	- Identify and explain the phases of UP
	- Compare and contrast details of UP and RUP

## Instantiating UP? &sect;2.5 ##

> UP (and RUP) must be instantiated for each project
> 

- UP is a generic SEP that has to be instantiated for a project
- It is a framework and not a "one size fits all" solution
- Initiating UP involves defining and incorporating:
	* in-house standards
	* document templates
	* establishing tools - modeling, compilers, configuration and project management
	* databases - bug tracking, project tracking
	* life cycle modifications - change control process, quality control
- RUP needs a similar process, but it provides some of the elements as part of the product
