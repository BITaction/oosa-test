## Examples of Information Technology Projects ##

- Upgrade hardware, software, networks
- Enhance existing systemsâ€™ business functions
- New systems
	- Develop a Robot simulation Application 
	- Convert a Life Insurance Application to support mobile devices
	- Develop an Application to allow residents to identify potholes using Google Maps

## Steps of Project Management &sect;1, pg 3 ##

1. __Initiate__: What is the challenge or problem?
2. __Plan__: How should we go about solving it?
3. __Control__: Are we on track?
	* Includes Executing and Monitoring the plan (to control variances)
	* Execution of the work is not a PM role
	* Monitoring the work and adjusting for variances is how the PM _controls_ a project
4. __Close__: Finish the job, assess how we did, and capture lessons learned

## Relationship of Steps &sect;1, Figure 1-1 ##

## Project Management as a Process &sect;1, pg 4 ##

- A project is a series of steps undertaken to achieve a specific outcome
- We will study the 4 steps of Figure 1-1
- Other projects may be defined with additional, more refined steps

---

### 1. Initiate a Project

Recognize the project and make it official.

- Recognize that the project needs to be done
- Determine what it needs to accomplish
- Identify the major _Project Stakeholders_, especially the _Project Sponsor_
- Launch the project with a _Project Charter_
- Project Manager is selected and given authority to create the _Project Team_

---

### 2. Plan a Project

Determine the requirements and how to complete them.

- Develop a detailed __Project Plan__ including:
	* task list
	* resource assignments
	* schedule
	* budget
	* communication plan
	* risk plan
	* change control
- Project Sponsor approves the plan (making it the _Project Baseline_)

---

### 3. Control a Project

Do the work on time, within budget, and according to the specified requirements.

- Project Team executes technical work according to the plan
- Project Manager maintains control by monitoring, coordinating, and communicating efforts among the Project Team and senior management
- Project Manager adjusts for variances and records them in an updated plan
- Project status reports are generated to keep Stakeholders informed

---

### 4. Close a Project

Perform last minute checks and ensure all requirements have been satisfied.

- __Hand Off__: Ensure deliverable is provided in full to the customer
- __Recycle__: Record lessons learned to pass on to others
- __Celebrate__: Reward the team and celebrate success

## Triple Constraint &sect;1, Figure 1-2 ##

![Triple Constraint][3constraint-image]

Constraint | What | Explanation
-----------|------|------------
Scope | Specifications of a project | The things you must do
Time  | Schedule of a project       | The time you have to do them
Cost  | Resources of a project      | The things you need to do them

---

> __Quality__ &rArr; determined by the effects of the constraints and how they are managed
>

- Constraints are what make it a project that needs project management
- Remove a constraint and you greatly reduce the need for project management
- The tighter the constraints the greater the need for project management

## Values of Project Management &sect;1, pg 6 ##

- Helps to get organized
- Offers disciplined approach
- Gateway to greater success

---

Eight specific reasons outlined in the textbook:

1. Establishes single point of contact in Project Manager with:
	* _Authority_: given right to impose a degree of discipline
	* _Accountability_: answerable to producing visible evidence of progress
	* _Responsibility_: moral obligation to do the right thing 
2. Focuses on meeting customer needs
3. Improves team performance
4. Obtains consistent results across business unit
5. Focuses on managing project scope and controlling change
6. Helps avoid disasters by managing risks
7. Strengthens project teams and improves morale
8. Improves bottom-line performance and grows the business (higher profits, lower costs)

## Too Much Project Management &sect;1, pg 10 ##

- Some project management can benefit nearly every project
- Too much project management can be detrimental if not matched to project size and complexity
	* Demoralized teams
	* Frustrated senior management
	* Project failure!
- Applying project management in smaller doses, measuring success, and adjusting can alleviate the risk

Read and study the real world examples given in the textbook.
