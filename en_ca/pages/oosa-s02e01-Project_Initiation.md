## Project Initiation ##

![Project Initiation Step][4steps-pm-init]

- The process of formally launching a project
- Requires a document, called the _Project Charter_ that states “We have a Project and this is what it is about”
- An approved Project Charter is the major deliverable of this step

## Is it a Project? &sect;2, pg 16 ##

- Clear __beginning__ and __end__
- Measurable objective
- One-of-a-kind effort requiring customized solution
- Requires a relatively quick response
- Requires coordinating and managing independent resources

## Project Start-Up &sect;2, pg 16 ##

- Determine key players (_Project Stakeholders_)
- Understand their roles and responsibilities

![Project Participants][project-participants]

### Project Sponsor (Owner) &sect;2, pg 17 ###

- A _Project Sponsor_ is the ultimate approval authority over a project
- Must be identified and must champion the project
- Can allocate and prioritize resources
- Provides funding for the project
- Should likely be the one who appointed the Project Manager
- Project Manager must be absolutely clear of this stakeholder (and hopefully has a direct communication with them)

### Project Manager (PM) &sect;2, pg 18 ###

- The _Project Manager_ has the experience, competence, knowledge, and skill to successfully manage a project
- Should usually be appointed by the Project Sponsor
- Must be given sufficient authority and exercise responsibility over a project (see Table 2-1)
- Ultimately accountable for a project (for better or worse)
- Study the main characteristics of Great Project Managers in the textbook

### Other Stakeholders &sect;2, pg 18 ###

- _Project Stakeholders_ are people (and sometimes institutions or companies) with a significant interest in a Project
- They have a lot at _stake_ in the Project – that’s why they are called Stakeholders
- Each stakeholder will have expectations and the PM must identify and manage these
- The Project Manager must identify all stakeholders
- The Customer and Project Sponsor are key stakeholders (and often the same person/organization)
- The members of the Project Team are valued stakeholders to help bring a project to fruition

## Project Repository &sect;2, pg 20 ##

- A _Project Repository_ is a common place to file documentation for a project
- Could be as simple as a ring binder or manilla folder
- Usually a combination of paper and electronic based filing
- See Table 2-2 for possible contents of a project repository

## The Project Charter &sect;2, pg 23 ##

- A _Project Charter_ is the document that formally recognizes the existence of a project and provides direction on the project’s objectives and management
- It is the absolute master document for the project – a bit like the Constitution for a country
- It identifies the Project Sponsor, Project Manager, and other Stakeholders
- The Project Sponsor is "officially" the originator of the charter
- The Project Manager is usually tasked in preparing it for the sponsor's approval (signature)

### Project Charter Sample &sect;2, Figure 2-3 ###

Many variations of Project Charters exist. See Figure 2-3 and pages 24-30 of the textbook, plus the points below for example items on typical project charters.

- General project information (Project name, Company name)
- Key stakeholders: Project Sponsor, Project Manager, Customer
- Other stakeholders
- Define the problem
- Identify the objectives
- List the constraints (time, budget, etc.)
- List the assumptions
- Outline the proposed solution
- List the major deliverables
- List the major success criteria
- Signatures of Project Sponsor and Project Manager

### Other Sample Charters ###

Project charters come in many variations of detail and complexity. Here is just a small sample of some project charter formats you might encounter.

- [Sample Charter][charter1]
- [Project Charter Information and Template][charter3]
- [Microsoft Word Project Charter Template][charter2]

### Distribution of the Charter &sect;2, pg 31 ###

- Once approved, the charter is distributed to the project team and internal stakeholders
- Not always advisable to distribute to external stakeholders like suppliers or consultants
- Confidentiality and privacy are major concerns

## Tasks ##

- A project is usually divided into smaller parts called tasks
- A task has a unity of purpose (example: install a Local area Network (LAN), Program Order classes, etc.)
- A task has a duration and is assigned to one or more persons (also knows as resources) who will perform it
- The division of a Project into groups of tasks & into tasks is called a _Work Breakdown Structure_ (WBS)
- For better understanding & managing, tasks are often laid out graphically from project start to project completion with time flowing from left to right and tasks listed from top to bottom
- This representation is called a GANTT chart

## Strategic Planning & Project Selection ##

- Strategic planning involves determining long-term objectives, predicting future trends, and projecting the need for new products and services.
- Organizations often perform a __SWOT__ analysis which analyzes Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats.
- As part of strategic planning, organizations will:
	- Use realistic methods to select which projects to work on
	- Formalize project initiation by issuing a project charter

## Project Integration Management Processes ##

- Develop the project charter: working with stakeholders to create the document that formally authorizes a project—the charter
- Develop the preliminary project scope statement: working with stakeholders, especially users of the project’s products, services, or results, to develop the high-level scope requirements and create a preliminary project scope statement
- Develop the project management plan: coordinating all planning efforts to create a consistent, coherent document—the project management plan
- Direct and manage project execution: carrying out the project management plan by performing the activities included in it
- Monitor and control the project work: overseeing project work to meet the performance objectives of the project
- Perform integrated change control: coordinating changes that affect the project’s deliverables and organizational process assets
- Close the project: finalizing all project activities to formally close the project
