## Project Initiation ##

- The process of formally launching a project
- Requires a document, called the _Project Charter_ that states “We have a Project and this is what it is about”
- An approved Project Charter is the sole deliverable of this step

## Is it a Project? &sect;1, pg 16 ##

- Clear beginning and end
- Measurable objective
- One-of-a-kind effort requiring customized solution
- Requires a relatively quick response
- Requires coordinating and managing independent resources

## Project Start-Up &sect;1, pg 16 ##

- Determine key players (_Stakeholders_)
- Understand their roles and responsibilities

## The Project Charter &sect;1, pg 23 ##

- the document that formally recognizes the existence of a project and provides direction on the project’s objectives and management
- It is the absolute master document for the project – a bit like the Constitution for a country.

## Project Charter Simple Version
- General Project information (Project name, company name…)
- Define the problem
- List the constraints (time, budget, etc.)
- Outline the proposed solution
- List the major deliverables
- List the Stakeholders
- List the major success criteria

## Stakeholders
- Stakeholders are the people (and sometimes institutions or companies) with a significant interest in the Project.
- They have a lot at stake in the Project – that’s why they are called Stakeholders.

##Tasks
- A project is usually divided into smaller parts called tasks.
- A task has a unity of purpose (example: install a Local area Network (LAN), Program Order classes, etc.)
- A task has a duration and is assigned to one or more persons (also knows as resources) who will perform it.
- The division of a Project into groups of tasks & into tasks is called a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).
- For better understanding & managing, tasks are often laid out graphically from Project start to Project completion with time flowing from left to right and tasks listed from top to bottom.
- This representation is called a GANTT chart.

## Strategic Planning & Project Selection
- Strategic planning involves determining long-term objectives, predicting future trends, and projecting the need for new products and services.
- Organizations often perform a __SWOT__ analysis which analyzes Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats.
- As part of strategic planning, organizations will:
	- Use realistic methods to select which projects to work on
	- Formalize project initiation by issuing a project charter

## Project Integration Management Processes
- Develop the project charter: working with stakeholders to create the document that formally authorizes a project—the charter
- Develop the preliminary project scope statement: working with stakeholders, especially users of the project’s products, services, or results, to develop the high-level scope requirements and create a preliminary project scope statement
- Develop the project management plan: coordinating all planning efforts to create a consistent, coherent document—the project management plan
- Direct and manage project execution: carrying out the project management plan by performing the activities included in it
- Monitor and control the project work: overseeing project work to meet the performance objectives of the project
- Perform integrated change control: coordinating changes that affect the project’s deliverables and organizational process assets
- Close the project: finalizing all project activities to formally close the project
