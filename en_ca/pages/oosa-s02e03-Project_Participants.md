[Software Stakeholder Example][stakeholders]

## The Core Team &sect;3, pg 35 ##

> Most important element of a project is an effective team; without it, the project cannot succeed
> 

- Project team will plan, implement, and monitor the work
- Project manager as a team member:
	* responsible for maintaining a cohesive, functioning, and capable team
	* involved with day-to-day interaction and operation of the team
	* a good leader, listener, learner, and lecturer
	* a source of motivation and encouragement to the team

## What is a Team ##

> __Work Team__: A group of individuals whose work is interdependent and who are collectively responsible for accomplishing a performance outcome
> 

- All Teams are characterized by:
	- A dynamic exchange of information and resources among team members
	- Task activities coordinated among individuals in the group
	- A high level of interdependence among team members
	- Ongoing adjustments to both the team and individual task demands
	- A shared authority and mutual accountability for performance (i.e., results)

## Factors Critical to Team Success ##

- A clear, challenging goal &lArr; most important factor
- A results-driven structure
- Competent, talented team members
- Unified commitment
- A positive team culture
- Standards of excellence
- External support and recognition
- Effective leadership

## Stages of Team Development ##

Teams tend to go through four phases:

1. __Forming__: Determination of roles
2. __Storming__: Individuals struggle for power
3. __Norming__: Members focus on their tasks
4. __Performing__: The team is a well-oiled machine
	
## Team Forming ##

- Team is first brought together
- Members are quiet, they size up the situation
- The Project Manager should:
	- Identify key team members based on nature of work
	- Introduce the project
	- Share the vision: sell the project, establish buy-in, obtain commitment
	- Establish roles & responsibilities
	- Ensure proper resources are allocated for team members
	- Conduct kickoff meeting to engage team members and generate excitement
	- Create situations for members to interact (assign a short term deliverable)

## Team Storming ##

- Members establish dominance and stake out their territories
- May be a fair bit of conflict &rArr; must always have some conflict
- At this stage a project leader should:
	* Be aware of what is happening
	* Reinforce roles during meetings
	* Be aware of people’s perspective when resolving conflicts
	* Remind members that their jobs depend on them working with everyone on the team

## Team Norming ##

- Individuals focus on their tasks
- Personal conflicts die down &rArr; conflicts about project work is regular and healthy
- Slight risk that members may avoid discussing issues that should be addressed
- At this stage a project leader should make sure that good solutions aren’t ignored because members want to avoid conflict

## Team Performing ##

- Member roles are clear
- New tasks are handled automatically
- Team member’s will deal with conflicts themselves
- Team mostly runs itself
- Project leader has minimal involvement in addressing team problems

## Four Key Elements of Team Performance ##

1. Communication
2. Decision Making
3. Collaboration
4. Self-Management

## Guidelines for Transitioning to a Collaborative Style ##

- Frame conflict in terms of problems to be resolved
- Develop objective criteria to help evaluated merits of proposed solutions to conflicts
- Consider alternatives
- Practice active listening
- Develop clear follow-up plans
- Stress goals and perspectives in common among team members
- Compromise solutions: the absolute very LAST resort
- Encourage, support, and reward candid and frequent communication among team members

## Conflict Management Styles ##

> Conflict is a natural and healthy aspect of any team project. It must not be personal, but rather about the project itself and it's up to the project manager to control this.
> 

Type | Cooperation | Assertiveness | Notes
-----|-------------|---------------|------
Avoiding | Low | Low | Parties withdraw
Accommodating | High | Low | Parties are overly accepting
Competing | Low | High | Parties push for their way (or the highway)
Collaborating | High | High | Parties work effectively with high degree of trust
Compromising | Medium | Medium | Parties negotiate with give and take
