## What is a Project ##

> A project is an endeavor to accomplish a specific objective through a unique set of interrelated tasks and the effective utilization of resources
 
## Attributes of a Project ##

- unique purpose with well-defined objectives
- temporary (has a defined starting and ending point)
- Is developed using progressive elaboration
- require resources, often from various areas
- should have a primary sponsor/customer
- involve uncertainty

## Examples of Information Technology Projects ##

- Upgrade hardware, software, networks
- Enhance existing systems’ business functions
- New systems
	- Develop a Robot simulation Application 
	- Convert a Life Insurance Application to support mobile devices
	- Develop an Application to allow residents to identify potholes using Google Maps
	- A Manufacturer merges with a retail company and they need to merge their systems

## Steps of Project Management &sect;1, pg 3 ##

1. __Initiate__: What is the challenge or problem?
2. __Plan__: How should we go about solving it?
3. __Control__: Are we on track?
	* Includes Executing and Monitoring the plan (to control variances)
	* Execution of the work is not a PM role
	* Monitoring the work and adjusting for variances is how the PM _controls_ a project
4. __Close__: Finish the job, assess how we did, and capture lessons learned

## Relationship of Steps &sect;1, Figure 1-1 ##

![Four Steps of PM][4steps-pm]

## Project Management as a Process &sect;1, pg 4 ##

- A project is a series of steps undertaken to achieve a specific outcome
- We will study the 4 steps of Figure 1-1
- Other projects may be defined with additional, more refined steps

### 1. Initiate a Project ###

Recognize the project and make it official.

- Recognize that the project needs to be done
- Determine what it needs to accomplish
- Identify the major _Project Stakeholders_, especially the _Project Sponsor_
- Launch the project with a _Project Charter_
- Project Manager is selected and given authority to create the _Project Team_

### 2. Plan a Project ###

Determine the requirements and how to complete them.

- Develop a detailed __Project Plan__ including:
	* task list
	* resource assignments
	* schedule
	* budget
	* communication plan
	* risk plan
	* change control
- Project Sponsor approves the plan (making it the _Project Baseline_)

### 3. Control a Project ###

Do the work on time, within budget, and according to the specified requirements.

- Project Team executes technical work according to the plan
- Project Manager maintains control by monitoring, coordinating, and communicating efforts among the Project Team and senior management
- Project Manager adjusts for variances and records them in an updated plan
- Project status reports are generated to keep Stakeholders informed

### 4. Close a Project ###

Perform last minute checks and ensure all requirements have been satisfied.

- __Hand Off__: Ensure deliverable is provided in full to the customer
- __Recycle__: Record lessons learned to pass on to others
- __Celebrate__: Reward the team and celebrate success

## Triple Constraint &sect;1, Figure 1-2 ##

![Triple Constraint][3constraint-image]

Image referenced from [How to Manage a Camel][3constraint-article]
 
Constraint | What | Explanation
-----------|------|------------
Scope | Specifications of a project | The things you must do
Time  | Schedule of a project       | The time you have to do them
Cost  | Resources of a project      | The things you need to do them

__Quality__: determined by the effects of the constraints and how they are managed

- Constraints are what make it a project that needs project management
- Remove a constraint and you greatly reduce the need for project management
- The tighter the constraints the greater the need for project management

## Values of Project Management &sect;1, pg 6 ##

- Helps to get organized
- Offers disciplined approach
- Gateway to greater success

Eight specific reasons outlined in the textbook:

1. Establishes single point of contact in Project Manager with:
	* _Authority_: given right to impose a degree of discipline
	* _Accountability_: answerable to producing visible evidence of progress
	* _Responsibility_: moral obligation to do the right thing 
2. Focuses on meeting customer needs
3. Improves team performance
4. Obtains consistent results across business unit
5. Focuses on managing project scope and controlling change
6. Helps avoid disasters by managing risks
7. Strengthens project teams and improves morale
8. Improves bottom-line performance and grows the business

## Too Much Project Management &sect;1, pg 10 ##

- Some project management can benefit nearly every project
- Too much project management can be detrimental if not matched to project size and complexity
	* Demoralized teams
	* Frustrated senior management
	* Project failure!
- Applying project management in smaller doses and measuring success can alleviate the risk

Read and study the real world examples given in the textbook.

## New Practice For a New Reality ##

> “We are often overwhelmed by the number of things that we have to do and still function productively with a clear head and a positive sense of relaxed control”
> 
> -- David Allen, 2007

## Getting Things Done (GTD) ##

- Also referred to as the Art of Stress-Free Productivity
- Created by David Allen
- Based on 2 key objectives:

	1. Capturing all things that need to get done – now, later, someday, big, little, or in between, get them out of your head and off your mind.
	2. Disciplining yourself to make front-end decisions about all of the “inputs” you let into your life so that you will always have a plan for “next actions” that you can implement or renegotiate at any moment.

- [Five Key Things about GTD][gtd5]

	1. Get it out of your head and into a reliable storage format (paper, digital, etc.)
	2. Focus on the _next action_ to be productive
	3. Clear your _Inbox_ on a daily basis
	4. Build a reliable filing system __and use it!__
	5. Review regularly (at least weekly)
