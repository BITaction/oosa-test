##  Getting Things Done (GTD)

- Also referred to as the Art of Stress-Free Productivity
- Created by David Allen
- Based on 2 key objectives:

	1. Capturing all things that need to get done – now, later, someday, big, little, or in between, get them out of your head and off your mind.
	2. Disciplining yourself to make front-end decisions about all of the “inputs” you let into your life so that you will always have a plan for “next actions” that you can implement or renegotiate at any moment.

- [5 Key Things about GTD][gtd5]

	1. Get it out of your head and into a reliable storage format (paper, digital, etc.)
	2. Focus on the _next action_ to be productive
	3. Clear your _Inbox_ on a daily basis
	4. Build a reliable filing system __and use it!__
	5. Review regularly (at least weekly)
