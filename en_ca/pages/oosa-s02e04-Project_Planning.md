## Learning Outcomes ##

	- Identify the major steps of the planning process
	
## Project Planning Basics &sect;3, pg 32 ##

![Project Initiation Step][4steps-pm-plan]

- Keep the plan as simple as possible relative to the size of the project
- Project Plans should cover the following:
	* __Project Summary__: high level summary of project origin and objectives
	* __Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)__: Numbered task list
	* __Resource Assignments__: Who is doing the work
	* __Project Schedule__: Completion dates of tasks and milestones
	* __Project Budget__: How money is allocated to the project
	* __Risk Assessment__: What can go wrong, and how to deal with it
	* __Communications__: How the team is expected to interact
	* __Change Control Process__: How change requests are handled
- Brainstorm with project team to create initial draft plan
- Project Manager refines plan with sponsor and customer
- Approved project plan forms a _baseline_

## Planning Process &sect;3, pg 33 ##

- Project Charter is the principal input to the project planning
- Project Manager should insist on signed charter before planning

Basic project planning is relatively straightforward (but hard work):

1. Break the work into manageable "chunks", forming a _Work Breakdown Structure_ (WBS)
- Identify dependencies between tasks
- Identify the duration of each task
- Assign resources to tasks
- Review, analyze, and refine the plan
- Get it approved

The documentation produced from project planning include:

- A _Project Schedule_ (what needs to be done and when)
- A _Critical Path_  (the critical tasks that can affect the delivery date)
- A _Risk Plan_ (the things that can go wrong and how they will be handled)
- A _Communication Plan_ (how to communicate with stakeholders and when)
- A _Change Control Plan_ (how to handle changes)

> The Project Plan and Project Charter pull together virtually everything that is known about the project
> 

## Time for Planning &sect;3, pg 34 ##

> If you don't spend the time planning you will spend the time reacting to negative consequences that arise from poor planning
> 

How much time should be spent on planning a project?

- Just enough time to get a clear understanding of what's required to complete the project objectives
- __Rule of Thumb__: minimum 5 percent of a project duration should be spent on planning
- Not all planning happens upfront, but rather forms part of the iterative process inherent in projects

## Planning Activities &sect;3, pg 36 ##

> The major steps of project planning are highlighted in Figure 3-1, pg 37
> 

### Review Project Requirements ###

> Don't solve the wrong problem in a perfect way
> 

- Review and analyze the requirements
- Make a plan before jumping into execution
- Validate with the customer
- Ensure you are solving the correct problem!

### Clarify Roles and Responsibilities ###

- Ensure you have the right team to solve the problem
- Balance between whom you want and who is available
- Clarify roles and responsibilities in writing to each member

### Conduct Project Kickoff Meeting ###

- Opportunity for all team members and stakeholders to learn about the project
- Project Manager responsible for calling and running the meeting:
	* Start the meeting on time
	* Achieve objectives by using an agenda (see sample Figure 3-2, pg 41)
	* Describe the project
	* Establish team identity (challenge, teamwork, collaboration)
	* Generate excitement
	* Finish the meeting on time
	* Make notes and distribute to attendees after meeting
- Review checklist in Table 3-1, pg 39

> Give the Project Sponsor opportunity to participate. They can show support for the project and explain how it fits into the overall business strategy of the organization.
> 

### Create WBS ###

### Assigning Resources ###

- Assign resources to tasks on the WBS structure
- Consider and resolve the following issues:
	- Who and what is needed for project success?
	- Who and what is available?
	- How can we make up for resource shortfalls?
	- What consequence will resource slippage have on the schedule?
- Discuss shortfalls with project sponsor to mitigate risks
- Assign resources by name ([Fred Penner][fredpenner]) or by role (Musician) if specific details are not yet known

### Schedule the Work ###

## Project Management Software &sect;3, pg 43 ##

> Project Management Software requires training and experience to use effectively!
> 

- Can assist in developing and maintaining project plans
- Can automatically organize the WBS structure based on indenting levels
- Can generate network diagrams and calculate critical paths
- Can manage resource assignments, work schedules, and costing
- Can track project progress and compare actuals with estimates
- Can do many, many specialized things...
- Can be relatively expensive and overkill for smaller projects
