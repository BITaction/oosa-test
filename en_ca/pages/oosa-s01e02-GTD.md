## Learning Outcomes ##

- You will learn:
	- Describe key objectives of GTD

	- Describe the purpose of Projects, Contexts, Due Dates, and Flags
	- Identify and explain elements/tools of a Trusted System
	- Apply GTD with a combination physical and software solutions

## Getting Things Done (GTD) ##

- Also referred to as the Art of Stress-Free Productivity
- Created by David Allen
- Based on 2 key objectives:

	1. Capturing all things that need to get done – now, later, someday, big, little, or in betweent them out of your head and off your mind.
	2. Disciplining yourself to make front-end decisions about all of the “inputs” you let into your life so that you will always have a plan for “next actions” that you can implement or renegotiate at any moment.

## Out of Mind &rArr; Into INBOX ##

- If it's on your mind, write it down and place in a trusted __INBOX__
- Frees your mind from thinking about that item
- Opens your mind to think about other things

## Process INBOX ##

- Go thru items in the INBOX on a regular basis
- If you don't need an item, trash it
- If it's just a reference item, file it
- Otherwise, it's likely a task, so process it

## Process Tasks ##

- If you can complete it in under two minutes, do it right now
- If it takes more that two minutes, organize it
- Assign tasks to a _Project_
	- What's a Project?
	- If you need to do two or more things to accomplish something, then it's a project
- Assign a _Context_ to each task
	- What's a Context?
	- A location or resource that can be utilized to accomplish a task
	- Examples: @Home, @Office, @Phone, @Email, @Shopping
	- Usually a single word and prefixed with "@" to distinguish from other things
	- Special context @Waiting to signify tasks that are waiting on something before moving forward
	- Keep the number of contexts low (i.e., don't make too many and use a general term for each one)
- Assign due dates to tasks where appropriate
- Assign a deferral date to tasks where appropriate to delay them
- Flag important tasks that need particular close attention
- Arrange tasks within a project so that the _next action_ is listed first
- There can be only one next action for each project

## Do Tasks ##

Look at your tasks from the perspective of projects, contexts, due dates, and flags to make decisions about what to do. Then pick something and do it.

- Look at projects to see:
	- the list of tasks to finish a project
	- the next action for each project
	- the due dates of tasks within a project
	- the flagged items in a project
- Look at contexts to see:
	- the tasks that can be completed under that context
	- the due dates of tasks within a context
	- the flagged items under a context
- Look at a calendar to see:
	- the tasks that must be completed by a specific date
	- the flagged items on the calendar
	- the context needed to complete the tasks
	- the projects where the tasks are assigned
- Look at flagged status to see:
	- the tasks flagged for close attention
	- the due dates of flagged tasks
	- the projects associated to these tasks
	- the contexts needed to complete each task

> Tasks are agreements, adjust them as needed &rArr; A renegotiated agreement is __not__ a broken agreement!
> 

## Trusted System ##

- There are many options to develop a trusted system for recording, processing, filing, and doing
- GTD hinges on creating a _trusted system_ that _works for you_
- Paper, binders, folders, email, software are all excellent alternatives
- One single approach is not likely to suffice for everything
- Iteration, review, and adjustment is a fundamental mantra of success

## [Wunderlist](http://www.wunderlist.com) ##

- A software solution for making to-do lists
- Can be used in a GTD fashion
- Main element is an INBOX
- Lists can serve as projects
- Tags can be used as contexts
- Due dates can be entered per task
- Tasks can be flagged

## [Five Key Things about GTD][gtd5] ##

1. Get it out of your head and into a reliable storage format (paper, digital, etc.)
2. Focus on the _next action_ to be productive
3. Clear your _Inbox_ on a daily basis
4. Build a reliable filing system __and use it!__
5. Review regularly (at least weekly)
