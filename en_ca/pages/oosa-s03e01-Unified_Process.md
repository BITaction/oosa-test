## Learning Outcomes ##

- Section &sect;2.10 of the UML 2 course textbook (UMLUP)
- You will learn to:
	- Define a Software Engineering Process (SEP)
	- Give examples of historical and modern SEPs
	- Define the Unified Process and its role as a SEP
	- Define the workflows and phases of UP
	- Explain the differences between UP and RUP
	- Explain iterative and incremental software development within UP/RUP

## What is UP? &sect;2.2 ##

> UP is a modern SEP driven by user requirements
> 

![Purpose of SEP][sep-use]

- __SEP__ is an acronym for _Software Engineering Process_, also referred to as [Software Development Process (SDP)][sdp]
- A SEP defines the _who, what, when, and how_ of software development
- A SEP helps turn user requirements into working software (see Figure 2.2, pg 29)
- The _Unified Software Development Process (USDP)_ is a SEP
- USDP is often referred to as just _Unified Process (UP)_
- So, UP is a SEP, a modern one that is driven to satisfy user requirements and manage risk
- UP provides the process framework for turning user requirements into working software

## What is RUP? ##

> RUP is a commercial SEP
> 

- __RUP__ is an acronym for [Rational Unified Process][rup], which is a commercial version of UP [maintained by IBM][rup-ibm]
- RUP extends UP in various ways such as process and terminology
- RUP and UP are more similar than different
- RUP describes a best practice process for developing software, and provides the tools and standards to help carry that out
