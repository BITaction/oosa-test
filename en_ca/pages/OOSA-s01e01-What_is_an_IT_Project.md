 “We are often overwhelmed by the number of things that we have to do and still function productively with a clear head and a positive sense of relaxed control”*

Also referred to as the Art of Stress-Free Productivity.  Created by David Allen.
Based on 2 key objectives.

Disciplining yourself to make front-end decisions about all of the “inputs” you let into your life so that you will always have a plan for “next actions” that you can implement or renegotiate at any moment
