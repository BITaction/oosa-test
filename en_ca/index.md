This site includes the notes and resource materials that are relevant to the course.

## Project Management (PM)

## Software Engineering Process (SEP) ##

A Software Engineering Process (__SEP__) defines the *who*, *what*, *when*, and *how* of software development. We will look at various approaches and then utilize one in more depth for the remainder of the course.

<!-- These terms need to go into a sub document What is a SEP

### Other Terms for SEP
- Software Development Process
- Software Development Life Cycle (__SDLC__), or just Lifecycle
- Software Development Methodologies
-->

- [The Unified Process (UP)](pages/oosa-s03e01-Unified_Process.md)
- Rational Unified Process (RUP)
- Other SEPs

## Modelling ##

Modelling in software engineering is the approach of designing a solution without actually writing much code. To accomplish this we will look at expressive visual languages that allow us to represent our ideas and share them with others (who are also familiar with these languages).
